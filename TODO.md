# TODO

[] Support multiple configurations (personal, work) without using branches (aka layer system)
	[] We can generate configurations that apply on top of a base one: a  default Brewfile with common cases and the we apply an aditional Brewfile for the current layer
	[] Use git-config conditional includes (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_conditional_includes)

[X] Allow sync comand to only sync a subset of the files (categories)
	[X] Use just one rsync file instead of one per folder with different categories as an obj map
	[X] Add a parameter to specify the categories to sync, comma separated

[] Add support for SDKMAN
